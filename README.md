## Advance Programming  Exam report (C++) 

I have uploaded the forthcoming files:

1) "bst.hpp", containing the C++ implementation of a binary search tree;

2) "benchmark.cpp", containing a C++ implementation which is used to measure the performance of the find() method for the binary search tree (unbalanced and balanced ) and for the std::map;

3) "makefile", which is used to compile the files;

4) "mean_std.awk", an awk script which computes mean and standard deviation of data contained in a single column file;

5) "action.sh", and "actions_small.sh", bash scripts which run the benchmark for big and small tree/map and produces three data files (for unbalanced tree, balanced tree, std::map each) containing mean and standard deviation for measurements;

6) "plot.gnu", "plot_small.gnu" gnuplot scripts used to generate the plots.

7) "timing.png" and "timing_small.png" generated with the scripts.
