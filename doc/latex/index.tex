The compilation of the files is done by running the \textquotesingle{}make\textquotesingle{} command; use the command \textquotesingle{}make clean\textquotesingle{} to remove object files and executables. The executable \textquotesingle{}benchmark.\+x\textquotesingle{} requires an argument from command line representing the number of nodes in the tree and std\+::map \+: e.\+g we can run \textquotesingle{}./benchmark.o 50\textquotesingle{} will run the tests for a tree and std\+::map with 50 nodes of (random int keys and int values). The corresponding output will be three sets of 11 time measurements for the find() method (for unbalanced tree, balanced tree, std\+::map each).
